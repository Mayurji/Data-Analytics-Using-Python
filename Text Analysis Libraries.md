 Â   NLTK. Provides a nice introduction into programming with Python and an introduction into Natural Language Processing.
    
    PyNLPl. Library for Natural Language Processing, written by Maarten van Gompel. Contains a lot of modules for dealing with text, specific formats encountered in the field, and interfacing with other external NLP software. All of the things we did in chapter three are readily available in PyNLPl.
    
    Scikit-learn: Easy-to-use and general-purpose machine learning in Python. Provides many implementations of machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes Classifiers, supervised and unsupervised cluster analysis and many more.
    
    Networkx (not yet for Python 3): NetworkX is a Python language software package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. Supports many output formats that can be imported by e.g. gephi.
    
    gensim (in development for Python 3 at https://github.com/samantp/gensimPy3): Topic modelling for humans. Good and easy to use library for many topic modelling algorithms, such as LSA and LDA.
    
    Pattern (not yet for Python 3): general Natural Language Processing library with support for Dutch and English part of speech tagging.
    
    Numpy: fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
    a powerful N-dimensional array object sophisticated (broadcasting) functions tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code useful linear algebra, Fourier transform,
    and random number capabilities.
    
    Scipy: open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. Very good and fast library for all kinds of scientific computations, cluster analysis etc.
    
    Matplotlib: Python plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
    
    lxml: Extensive library for processing XML files in Python.
    
    Django: Interested in full fledged web-development? Django is an amazing open-source framework for Python that allows you to make complex web applications.
